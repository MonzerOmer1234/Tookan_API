                  When something is wrong with a request, the API will respond
                  with a non-
                  <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">200</a> status code
                  in the response. To help you better understand the problem,
                  where possible, the API overloads a number of different error
                  codes so your application logic has as much visibility as
                  possible into what has gone wrong.

                    minutes are added to X to make it UTC time.

                    half hours into minutes i.e 330 minutes. Since India’s time
                    is ahead of UTC time to convert it into UTC time 330 minutes
                    has to be subtracted from it. So, timezone is -330.

                  each task. "meta_data" or "pickup_meta_data" key should be
                  detailed as follows -

                    shown in the template settings page and "data" with the
                    value of that key. Both the keys should be of string Data
                    Type. For ex -
